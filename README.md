# SmartWatts

SmartWatts is a self-adaptive software-defined power meter for containerized environments.

## Naming convention

We work with the current python linters for normalize our code: **pylint**, **flake8** and **mypy**.

When an actor is defined (class herited by the Actor main abstract class), try to respect this rules:
 - The package name have to follow this pattern: "actor_xxxx_yyyy.py"
 - The class name have to follow this pattern: "ActorXxxxYyyy"
