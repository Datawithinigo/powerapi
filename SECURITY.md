# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The PowerAPI team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/powerapi/security/advisories/new) tab.  
**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

The PowerAPI team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.  
If your report is about a security issue in a formula, please follow the Security Policy in its own repository.
